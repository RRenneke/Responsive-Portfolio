In this project, three HTML pages were created to make a responsive portfolio. 

1. An index page about myself

2. A portfolio page about the projects I have done. Since this is only my second project, there are placeholders with images and a description.

3. A contact page with a way to contact me.

Bootstrap was used to create a navigation bar, incorporate a responsive layout, and for responsive images. The sites minimize to the use of media queries and utilizes containers and rows.
